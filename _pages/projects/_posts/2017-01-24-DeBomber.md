**DeBomber** is an iOS mobile game developed by a 4-person group.  
It's the result of a semester-long project for CSCI 526 Mobile Game course at University of Southern California. It's family game against your intuition on color and text, and also a challenge to your reaction.  
There are two modes of the DeBomber game: clear bombs and collect bombs.  
The goal of clear mode is simple: clear as many **consistent bombs** as possible within one minute! Here a **consistent bomb** is defined as a bomb whose color is exactly the same as the word shown on it.  
The goal of collect mode, on the other hand, is to complete as many assign tasks as possible, where an **assigned task** is a groupd of 4 randomly generated bombs shown on the bottom side of the screen and the player collects dropping bombs by dragging them to the corresponding positions.   
The language used in this project was Swift and we developed things from scratch (i.e. no other game engine was used. Only Xcode IDE.).  
Here's  a video demo of the DeBomber game:
