Recursively try every word to find every possible combination. The key is to be able to quickly know what choices do we have given current state.

Number of word choices are directly decided by their prefix. Hence, `Trie` is a good choice here.  
When we currently have $$k$$ words, the next word's prefix will be the $$k^{th}$$ letter of all words in top-down order. Use `StringBuilder` to generate this prefix and retrieve candidates of next word from the Trie.  
Time Complexity: $$O(n^2)$$
