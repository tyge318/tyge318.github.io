Trick is on **line 5**.  
Variable `temp` is to hold previous element. And `i%2 == 1` tells whether its index is odd or even.  
If `i%2 == 1` is **true**, then current element is on odd position, and it needs to $$\ge$$ previous element.  
Thus, if `temp > nums[i]` is **true** (i.e. violate the condition), then we need to swap. Otherwise it meets the condition.  
Similarly, if `i%2 == 1` is **false**, then current element is on even position, and it needs to $$\lt$$ previous element.  
Thus, if  `temp > nums[i]` is **false** (i.e. current $$\gt$$ previous, violate the condition), then we need to swap. Otherwise it meets the condition.  
Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Java Code:

public class Solution {
    public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            int temp = nums[i-1];
            if( (i%2 == 1) == (temp > nums[i]) ) {
                nums[i-1] = nums[i];
                nums[i] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
