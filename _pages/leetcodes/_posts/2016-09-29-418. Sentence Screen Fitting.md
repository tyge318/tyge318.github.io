title: 418. Sentence Screen Fitting
categories: leetcode
---
Try to fit the chunk of **sentence string** (space joined sentence with an extra space at the end) to each row.  
The **sentence string** chunk is the **maximum lengthed partial sentence string without cutted word**.  
The trick is, use `pos % len` to test if next row starts with a space. If so, then the space can be elinimated so we need to increase `pos`. Otherwise, there's a word cut and we need to decrease `pos` until we meet a space, so that the next word can be completely displayed on the next row.  
Time Complexity: <span class="inlinecode">$O(m*n)$</span> where <span class="inlinecode">$m$</span> is number of row and **n** is the maxmimum word length in the sentence.  

The execution tiime of the `while` loop all depends on the length of each word in the sentence. Thus, it can be pre-computed outside the loop, and the time complexity will be reduced to <span class="inlinecode">$O(m+n)$</span>.  
### Java Code:

public class Solution {
    public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.length, ptr = 0, ans = 0;
        int multiple = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
            if( ptr == 0 && i != 0 ) {
                multiple = i;
                i = (rows/multiple)*multiple;
                ans *= (rows/multiple);
                if( i >= rows )
                    break;
            }
            int remain = cols - sentence[ptr].length();
            if( remain < 0 )
                continue;
            ptr++;
            if( ptr == n ) {
                ans++;
                ptr = 0;
            }
            while( remain >= (1+sentence[ptr].length()) ) {
                remain -= (1+sentence[ptr].length());
                ptr++;
                if( ptr == n ) {
                    ans++;
                    ptr = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
