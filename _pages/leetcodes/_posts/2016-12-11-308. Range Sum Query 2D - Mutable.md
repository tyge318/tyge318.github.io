This is not the **Binary Index Tree** solution as tagged in the problem, but it's easier to understand.  
Basically just recompute the accumulative sum for each row and use them to reduce the run time to linear.  
Note that we need to memorize the (original/un-accumulated) matrix in order to do update.  
Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$ for update and $$O(m)$$ for sumRegion, where $$m, n$$ stand for **row size** and **column size**.

Here's the **Binary Index Tree** version code. The time complexity will be $$O(\log m * \log n)$$
