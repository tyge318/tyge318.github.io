Use the **sliding window** method.  
We need two variables `i` and `begin`, each marks the **end** and **begin** of the sliding window.  
Scan through each character with variable `i` and keep track of their frequency using hashmap. The size of the hashmap is the nubmer of distinct characters. Thus whenever its value is greater than $$k$$, we need to adjust the size of the sliding window (i.e. move variable `begin`) and update the character frequency of the sliding window, until a character's frequency becomes 0 and we remove it from the hashmap. (This results in the hashmap size backing to $$k$$.)  
Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$
