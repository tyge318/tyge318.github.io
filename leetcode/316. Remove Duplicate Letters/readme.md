This is equivalent to **find the subsequence of a string which has minimum lexicographic order and also contains all letters**. Here's how you maintain the minimum lexicographic order: whenever you encounter a letter, you want to make sure all its precedding letters in the result string have smaller ASCII codes, unless the removal of a precedding letter would result in a **letter miss**.  
Now the first question is: When can we saftely remove a precedding letter? If we are sure we will meet this precedding letter again. Thus we need to count the occurrence of each letter in string `s` and keep track if we have more of this letter exists afterwards. This can be easily done by the use of an int array `trace[]`.  
The second question is: How to have an efficient trace on the precedding letter in the result string? The data structure we are looking for is **stack**.  
For each letter in string `s`, loop through the letter on the stack top; pop from the stack if `stack.peek() > current_letter` and the removal of `stack.peek()` will not reulst in **letter miss**.  
(In Java, we can just use `StringBuilder` to simulate a stack: append() as stack push, deleteCharAt() as stack pop, etc.)
